    for now im just going to work with two motors and try to balance them

    as a first attemp what im going to do is  say that both of the motors should throttle
    to whatever its receiving and then that one of them should go faster or slower
    deping on the orientation

    later on what we should do is either have an altitude sensor so we can set
    which motor goes faster or slower depends on which action wilk keep the quadcopter
    at the same height
    first thing to do is to use the accelerometer and gyroscope to get an orientation
    the second thing to do is use that orientation and change the ouput of one of the motors
    which is the PID algorith that im first just going to write as a P algorithm
    but i'll do that tomorrow

first im gonna write all of the concepts in the simplest terms as comments and then i'll actually code them making sure im not making
any conceptual mistakes, but also if you guys have time, feel free to get started, Just write it generally so that its easy to modify if it needs to be.
assumptions:
motor 1 is accross from motor 3, and 2 accros from 4 and
that 1 and 3 are spinning in the same direction which is the opposite direction
of motors 2 and 4 and that we're flying in and 'x' orientation, meaning motors 1 and 2 are the 'front'
Modifying it so that it flies in "+" orientation is slightly more complicated but after writing all of this it should be an
easy modification that can be done during flight.

Note: that i separated all the cases, but in general we will want combinations of all of these "motions" so the case will be to either add
or subtract (modify rather than set) to the current w_n so that we get the correct thrust in all directions giving us the motion that we want.
also at this point, i assume that we've managed to figure out the sensors so we can appropriately set w_1-4
ALSO look out for any mistakes and make sure this make sense, and ask me for any clarifications!

Now the slightly more complicated part

roll motion(moving left and right):

this time the imbalance will be such that (|w_1| +|w_4|) - (|w_2| +|w_3|) !=0
similar to yaw motion rotation about the y axis ie tilting(8uj8u) the qc left and right and be proportional to (|w_1| +|w_4|) - (|w_2| +|w_3|) !=0

condition 2 in 'hover' is no longer true
what this means is that the T are now going to be decomposed into a component in the +/- z direction  and a component in the +/- x direction
lift T=T*cos(rollAngle)
L/R  T=T*sin(rollAngle)
We want the qc to stay at the same height so we actually have to adjust this Lift T s.t lift T=T*cos(phi)=mg so w_n will have to be increased

next i'll write how this is changed by flying in the '+' orientation and how we can easily modify the code so that we can change flight
orientations as well as some other more advanced things.
One thing that we should think about is how we want the quadcopter to do after we stop giving it commands from the transmitter.
If we are telling it to go to the left and then stop, should the qc keep going to the left and if we want it to stop completely we have to tell it
to go to the right a proportional amount so that it stays still or if we stop telling it to go left should it go automatically to a hover position?
or both... I actually think that it should be some more complicated combination of both, but i havent thought about it that much.
also if you guys have questions about dynamics things you should add it to this, even if we talk about it so that we dont forget and so that we can
potentially explain them better.
